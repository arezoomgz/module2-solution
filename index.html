                    alfredo pasta is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese (Italian: pasta al burro e parmigiano). As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich sauce coating the pasta. The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.
